The meeting agenda will generally be prepared in advance by opening tickets on the https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues[issue tracker] and tagging them with the `meeting` label.

== How to Join

Anyone can join the SIG by asking to become a member. If no existing SIG member *opposes* that request within a week, they're in. If an existing SIG member opposes, we will hold a regular vote at the next scheduled meeting as described above.

Prospective members can ask to join by filing a "New Member Request" ticket on the https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues/new/choose[issue tracker].
