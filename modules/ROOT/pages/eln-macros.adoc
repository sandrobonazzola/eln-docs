= ELN Macros

The ELN buildroot defines the %\{rhel\} macro as the next major version of RHEL
(currently, 11), and does not define the %\{fedora\} macro. For almost all cases,
this is sufficient for differentiating build behavior between Fedora and ELN.

== Request Permission

To avoid unnecessary divergence between ELN and the next version of RHEL,
the ELN SIG must approve each request for use of the %\{eln\} macro.

To request permission, create an https://github.com/fedora-eln/eln/issues[ELN Issue].

Be sure to include why you need to distinguish ELN from RHEL and/or CentOS Stream,
and why use of the %\{fedora\}, %\{rhel\}, and/or %\{centos\} macros does not suffice.
