= Fedora ELN compose =

== Summary ==

The Fedora ELN compose is built using the
https://docs.pagure.org/pungi/[Pungi] compose tool.

The compose runs automatically four times per day, at 0300, 1500, 1800 and
2100 UTC, though only the first successful compose each day is normally synced
to the mirrors. The https://tiny.distro.builders/[Content Resolver] uses each
of the composes for input processing to keep an accurate view of the state
of ELN throughout the day. The additional composes also serve to offer an
early-warning system of trouble so developers can fix reported issues before
the next day's synced compose.


== Compose configuration files ==

The main Fedora ELN compose configuration is stored in the official
https://pagure.io/pungi-fedora/ repository in the ``eln`` branch.

The Fedora ELN compose uses the ``comps-eln.xml`` file stored in the
https://pagure.io/fedora-comps repository.


== Generating the Fedora ELN compose ==

Members of the
https://accounts.fedoraproject.org/group/sysadmin-eln/[sysadmin-eln] Fedora Accounts (FAS) group
can manually generate a Fedora ELN compose by logging into the compose host
and performing the following steps:

[NOTE]
The first time you need to log in to an infrastructure compose host, you will
need to set up your SSH configuration as described in
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/infra/sysadmin_guide/sshaccess/#_ssh_configuration[Fedora Infrastructure Documentation].

1. Log in to compose-eln01.iad2.fedoraproject.org
2. Verify that no compose is already running with ``ps -ef|grep pungi-koji``
   or a similar command.
3. Edit the file ``/etc/cron.d/eln``, copying the line containing
   ``eln-nightly.sh`` to a new line and modifying the cron syntax to start the
   compose two minutes in the future. For example, if the current time is
   1520 UTC, you would set the ``cron`` configuration to ``22 15 * * *``.
4. Wait for the compose to start, verifying that it did so with
   ``ps -ef|grep pungi-koji``
5. Remove the additional entry in ``/etc/cron.d/eln`` so that it does not
   continue to trigger at the same time each day.
6. (Optional) watch the overall compose progress with

    tail -f /mnt/koji/compose/eln/<compose_id>/logs/global/pungi.global.log

NOTE: Normally, the ELN compose will only sync to the mirror list the first
time that a compose succeeds for that day. In rare situations, this might need
to be overridden. In this case, you will need to change the command used to
launch the compose to include a ``-f`` argument to ``eln-nightly.sh``.
