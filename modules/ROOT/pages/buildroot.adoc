== Versioning

In ELN project we work on the buildroot configuration rather than the content of Fedora packages. As ELN
buildroot configuration might change frequently and independently from Fedora releases, it has its own
versioning.

This approach allows us to rebuild RPM packages on buildroot changes without changing the spec file of a
package in dist-git.

ELN Buildroot version is written as `XY`.

The `X` version refers to major changes in the ELN buildroot (generally those events that necessitate a
mass-rebuild). The `Y` version refers to changes in the buildroot configuration that are compatible and will
apply to future builds in the ELN buildroot.

We start this number at `100`, where `1` is the X version and `00` is the Y version.

== Distribution-related Macro Definitions

In ELN buildroot we build Fedora Rawhide packages in the EL-like setting. Thus, following macro values are set
by default:

.Macros values
[options="header"]
|==============================================================================================================
|Macro         |Value         | Description
| `%\{fedora}` | `%\{nil}`    | Unset
| `%\{rhel}`   | `11`         | Integer value one higher than the most recently released major version of RHEL
| `%\{eln}`    | `XY`         | Version of the eln buildroot. Not tied to any RHEL or Fedora release.
| `%\{dist}`   | `.eln%\{eln}`| eln-disttag, for example `.eln101`
|==============================================================================================================


We set these values in Koji for the `eln-build` tag as follows:

```
koji edit-tag \
        -x rpm.macro.fedora=%{nil} \
	-x rpm.macro.rhel=9 \
	-x rpm.macro.eln=101 \
	-x 'rpm.macro.dist=%{!?distprefix0:%{?distprefix}}%{expand:%{lua:for i=0,9999 do print("%{?distprefix" .. i .."}") end}}.eln%{eln}%{?with_bootstrap:~bootstrap}' \
	eln-build
```

== Compiler flags and other tweaks

.Compiler Flags
[options="header"]
|==============================================================================================================
| Arch         | Rawhide                      | ELN
| aarch64      | -                            | -
| i686         | -                            | -
| ppc64le      | -                            | -
| s390x        | `-march=zEC12 -mtune=z13`    | `-march=z14 -mtune=z15`
| x86_64       | -                            | `-march=x86-64-v2`
|==============================================================================================================

The compiler flag tweaks can be found in `/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros`
The above options are from `redhat-rpm-config-200-1`


[#building]
== Building with the ELN buildroot

Simply specify `eln` as the release when kicking off a `koji` build using `fedpkg`:

```
fedpkg --release eln build [--scratch] [--srpm [SRPM]] [...]
```

`mock` can also be used to perform builds locally.

A supported `mock` configuration is available in the `mock-core-configs` package version 33 or later.
This enables the ELN environment to be used locally by running (for arch `x86_64`):

```
mock -r fedora-eln-x86_64 ...
```

[NOTE]
====
If the official `mock` configuration is not yet available, an unsupported configuration file can be downloaded link:{attachmentsdir}/fedora-eln-x86_64.cfg[here]. See link:https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/pull/649[mock#649]
